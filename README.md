# Overview

Unit Converter is my introductory app to the iOS development world. It shows the user an input field for a number, the user selects a unit measure for the input and also for the output. Then, the app instantly converts the input to the desired output. Right now it only works with a couple of units.

The logic behind the conversions is managed by the Measurement class buit into Swift. The interface of the app was created with Swift UI.
